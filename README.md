## Updates for "classical" libupnp

[Original README here](README)

This repository is a fork of the 
[Portable SDK for UPnP Devices](http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/)  
project, which itself forked the original Intel project in 2006, motivated
by the stagnation of the original project.

It seems that history sorts of repeats itself, because the current
Sourceforge project linked above does not receive many updates.

This repository will continue tracking branch 1.6 of the Sourceforge
project, but will also be updated with bug fixes which appear to have
trouble getting into the Sourceforge repository.

This README will keep a synthetic description of the local updates.
